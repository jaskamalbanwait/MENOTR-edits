# MENOTR-edits
The MENOTR codes (https://github.com/ZachIngram/2021-MENOTR) are used for analyzing data which often contains same independent variable for different sets of data. But, in my case, my independent varibale is usually different for different data sets. So, when I have to analyze all data set globally, the MENOTR codes need some modification in order to accomodate different independent variables for different data set.
The workaround (https://github.com/ZachIngram/2021-MENOTR) was to flag the different indepedent variables and hence, tag the different independent variable with the particular data set.
The modifications made by me take care of flags in NLLS fitting routine.
